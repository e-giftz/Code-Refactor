# Code-Refactor
## Class Homework

## Description
This project involved refactoring an already existing code. 

The existing code was edited and improved upon without changing what it does to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology, mostly the accessibility statndards as well as long term sustainability.

The index.html file was edited to include semantic HTML tags as well as re-organized so that the HTML elements follow a logical structure with a few comments to give more details on the syntax used. Modifications were also made to the html file with  accessibility in mind so that the alt attributes were added to the images.

The CSS file was modified and re-organized to reflect the changes made in the HTML file. Descriptive comments were added and CSS properties were consolidated were necessary.

**Note**: This layout is designed for "desktop", which implies that some of the elements may move positions when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px.
